Overview
--------

This repository contains code and resources for working with the **ESP32**, a low-cost, power-efficient microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. It is ideal for IoT applications, embedded systems, and automation projects.

Features
--------

*   **Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Connectivity**
    
*   **Low Power Consumption**
    
*   **Multiple GPIO, PWM, ADC, and DAC pins**
    
*   **Supports Arduino, MicroPython, and ESP-IDF**
    

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Arduino IDE** (with ESP32 board support) or **PlatformIO**
    
*   **ESP-IDF** (if using the official development framework)
    
*   USB-to-Serial drivers for ESP32
    

### Installation

1.  git clone https://github.com/yekyawaung91/esp32.gitcd esp32
    
2.  Install the required libraries in the **Arduino IDE** or **PlatformIO**.
    
3.  Connect your ESP32 board and select the appropriate board and port.
    
4.  Upload the code and monitor the serial output.
    

Example Projects
----------------

*   **Blink LED**: Simple LED blinking using ESP32 GPIO
    
*   **Wi-Fi Web Server**: Hosting a basic web page on ESP32
    
*   **MQTT Communication**: Sending data over MQTT protocol
    
*   **IoT Sensor Data Logging**: Collecting sensor data and sending it to a cloud platform
